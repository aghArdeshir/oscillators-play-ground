# Oscillators Play-Ground

Uses HTML5's AudioContext's Oscillator and a super-ugly UI to play tones with your keyboard

All pure JS, CSS & HTML

## Run

Well, Open `index.html` in a modern browser (by modern I mean [this table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode#Browser_compatibility))
and start pressing the keys printed on screen

> // or just go to [https://aghardeshir.github.io/oscillators-play-ground/](https://aghardeshir.github.io/oscillators-play-ground/)

## Fun

Note the difference of default wavetypes (`sine`, `square`, `triangle` & `sawtooth`) on FireFox & Chrome :)

My chrome plays it a little distorted

## Develop

Well, code ...
